    The Zone History add-on is intended to present historical information about the area or equipment selected. The results of the report show the amount of
    time spent in each equipment color in the range of time selected. Clicking on an equipment will show a pie chart of the time the equipment spent in each
    color while clicking on an area or system will show a pie chart that combines the results from all of the equipment beneath the selected area.
    It also provides a sortable table of equipment statistics that can be very valuable when looking for problem zones.
</p>

<h1>Using the Interface</h1>

<div class="innerDiv">
    <h2>System Tree</h2>

    <p>
        On the left of the page is the system tree. This tree is a "thin" tree that only shows zone equipment (equipment
        with a setpoint) and their parents. Selecting any item in the tree causes the page to immediately collect
        and display the results. If an area is selected, the main pie chart shows an aggregate view of all zone
        equipment below that area. Also, a table is shown below the pie chart that lists each zone equipment and shows
        their individual percentages and pie charts.
    </p>

    <h2>Time Range</h2>

    <p>
        The drop down menu at the top of the page controls the time range that is analyzed:
        <ul>
            <li>Today includes from midnight of the current day up to the current time.</li>
            <li>Yesterday includes all of the previous day.</li>
            <li>Previous 7 (or 31) days includes the specified number of previous days (not including today).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Main Pie Chart</h2>

    <p>
        Once an item in the tree has been selected (and the data collected and processed) a large pie chart is
        displayed to the right of the tree. This pie chart displays the percent of time spent in each color for the
        tree item that was selected.
        If the selected tree item is an area, then the pie chart shows the combined results for all the zones beneath it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: The legend to the side of the pie chart may combine the smallest percentages into a group called "Others."
    </p>

    <h2>Zone Equipment Table</h2>
    <p>
        The table that shows the individual details for each zone equipment  beneath that area is show below the main
        pie chart. Each row of the table contains the display path to the equipment, the time spent in cooling, heating,
        occupied, the average environmental index, and a small pie chart for the zone. These values are calculated by looking at
        the amount of time spent in groups of colors. Cooling and heating times are the percent of time spent in their
        respective moderate, maximum, and alarm colors.
        Time Occupied is the percent of time that the zone was occupied (either because of schedule or a local override).
        Average EI is the average value of the EI trend over the specified time range.

        Clicking on a column of the table will sort the column.

        Clicking anywhere in a row will select that equipment in the system tree and display the equipment using the large pie chart.
    </p>
</div>
<h1>Including in Views</h1>

<div class="innerDiv">
    <img src="vbcontentproperties.png" alt="Picture of the WebApp Content properties panel in ViewBuilder"
         style="padding-right: 1em; float:left"/>

    <p>
        This add-on also offers the ability to include the pie chart in a ViewBuilder view. To do this, place a "WebApp
        Content" control on a view. Once this is done, select the control and fill out the properties.
    </p>

    <p>
        The "WebApp Name" property should be the name from the "Application" column of the "Web Applications" page
        (which is the name of the WAR file without the .war extension).
    </p>
    <p>
        You typically leave "Content Path" empty which indicates that the zone history calculations should be done from
        the location where this graphic is attached.  You may, however, specify a GQL path to an alternate location.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, if the
        location is at an area, all zone equipment below that location will be analyzed and their results
        aggregated together in the displayed pie chart. This can be an expensive operation (at least the first time
        it is run in a day), so use carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the pie will resize to fit into the given space, any of the optional text values that you enable will
        not resize.  If you decide to use the &quot;showcooling&quot; or other similiar options, it is recommended to
        have a minimum width of 90 for the WebApp Content control to avoid scroll bars.
    </p>

    <p style="clear:left; padding-top:1em;">
        Lastly, set up any parameters that you need in order to control the behavior of the included content. The
        available parameters are:
    </p>
    <table class="params">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th> <th>Default Value</th> <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>prevdays</td> <td>0</td>
            <td>Equipment color data is analyzed from midnight of this number of days ago until midnight of the current day with the exception of calculating today's values which range
                from today at midnight until the time the test was requested. The maximum value is 31.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>showlegend</td> <td>false</td>
            <td>Specify "true" to show the legend of what each color in the pie chart means.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>showcooling</td> <td>false</td>
            <td>Specify "true" to show the percentage of time the area or equipment has been spent cooling.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>showheating</td> <td>false</td>
            <td>Specify "true" to show the percentage of time the area or equipment has been spent heating.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>showoccupied</td> <td>false</td>
            <td>Specify "true" to show the percentage of time the area or equipment has been spent occupied.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>showei</td> <td>false</td>
            <td>Specify "true" to show the average Environmental Index for the area or equipment. Note: The Environmental Index trend source must be named "zn_enviro_indx_tn"</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

<h1>Configuring Trending</h1>
<div class="innerDiv">
    <p>
        Zone History relies on trends of zone color and Environmental Index.  The name of the color trend does not matter,
        but EI must be trended with a wire trend that has a reference name of &quot;<span class="examp">zn_enviro_indx_tn</span>&quot;.
        For performance reasons, the Zone History add-on only uses trend information that has already been captured by
        Trend Historian.  Reading the most recent information from the field would just take too long for most systems.
        You must ensure that both color and EI are trended and that the values are regularly sent to the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        In WebCTRL 5.5 or greater, the "Enable Server Trending of Color" option with a Poll Interval of 5 minutes should
        work great for trending color (and this is the recommended setting).  If, however, you decide to use a wire
        trend, set it to COV, enable the Historian, and set the historian notification threshold to 1 sample.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the EI trend, it is recommended to use a historian notification threshold that reports to the server every
        hour.  For the default EI section generated by EquipmentBuilder, it uses a custom microblock that will trend
        about every 5 minutes.  This would need a threshold of 12.
